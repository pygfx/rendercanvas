"""
Demo
----

An example that uses events to trigger some canvas functionality.

A nice demo, and very convenient to test the different backends.

* Can be closed with Escape or by pressing the window close button.
* In both cases, it should print "Close detected" exactly once.
* Hit "f" to spend 2 seconds doing direct draws.
* Hit "s" to async-sleep the scheduling loop for 2 seconds. Resizing
  and closing the window still work.
