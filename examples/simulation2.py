"""
Running a simulation, part 2
----------------------------

In this example, we run a simulation (Conway's Game of Life),
where the simulation and rendering both run at their own pace.
This is convenient when you want to run a simulation as fast as possible,
and just have the animation to 'keep an eye' on it.

To allow the simulation to run concurrently, we implememt it as an async
function that is added as a task. The animation simply renders the current
grid.

Note that this example uses the bitmap context, but this can be used
with wgpu in the same way.

Note that this works for any backend, and does not require the asyncio event loop.
