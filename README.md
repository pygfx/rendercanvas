## Introduction

See how the two windows above look the same? That's the idea; they also look the
same to the code that renders to them. Yet, the GUI systems are very different
(Qt vs glfw in this case). Now that's a powerful abstraction!


## Purpose

* Provide a generic canvas API to render to.
* Provide an event loop for scheduling events and draws.
* Provide a simple but powerful event system with standardized event objects.
* Provide various canvas implementations:
  * One that is light and easily installed (glfw).
  * For various GUI libraries (e.g. qt and wx), so visuzalizations can be embedded in a GUI.
  * For specific platforms (e.g. Jupyter, browser).


The main use-case is rendering with [wgpu](https://github.com/pygfx/wgpu-py),
but ``rendercanvas``can be used by anything that can render based on a window-id or
by producing rgba images.


## Installation

```
pip install rendercanvas
```

To have at least one backend, we recommend:
```
pip install rendercanvas glfw
```

## Usage

Also see the [online documentation](https://rendercanvas.readthedocs.io) and the [examples](https://github.com/pygfx/rendercanvas/tree/main/examples).

```py
# Select either the glfw, qt or jupyter backend
from rendercanvas.auto import RenderCanvas, loop

# Visualizations can be embedded as a widget in a Qt application.
# Supported qt libs are PySide6, PyQt6, PySide2 or PyQt5.
from rendercanvas.pyside6 import QRenderWidget


# Now specify what the canvas should do on a draw
TODO

```

## Developers

* Clone the repo.
* Install `rendercanvas` and developer deps using `pip install -e .[dev]`.
* Use `ruff format` to apply autoformatting.
* Use `ruff check` to check for linting errors.
* Optionally, if you install [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/) hooks with `pre-commit install`, lint fixes and formatting will be automatically applied on `git commit`.
* Use `pytest tests` to run the tests.
