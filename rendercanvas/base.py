class BaseRenderCanvas:
    """The base canvas class.

    Each backends provides its own canvas subclass by implementing a predefined
    set of private methods.

    This base class defines a uniform canvas API so render systems can use code
    that is portable accross multiple GUI libraries and canvas targets. The
    scheduling mechanics are generic, even though they run on different backend
    event systems.

    Arguments:
        size (tuple): the logical size (width, height) of the canvas.
        title (str): The title of the canvas. Can use '$backend' to show the RenderCanvas class name,
            and '$fps' to show the fps.
        update_mode (EventType): The mode for scheduling draws and events. Default 'ondemand'.
        min_fps (float): A minimal frames-per-second to use when the ``update_mode`` is 'ondemand'.
            The default is 1: even without draws requested, it still draws every second.
        max_fps (float): A maximal frames-per-second to use when the ``update_mode`` is 'ondemand'
            or 'continuous'. The default is 30, which is usually enough.
        vsync (bool): Whether to sync the draw with the monitor update. Helps
            against screen tearing, but can reduce fps. Default True.
        present_method (str | None): The method to present the rendered image.
            Can be set to 'screen' or 'image'. Default None (auto-select).
